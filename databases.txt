We have two kinds of databases, SQL (for instance MySQL) and NoSQL (for instance MongoDB)

1. SQL 
a. tables, such as users, products, and so on. 
b.collumns, such as name, email, password and so on. 
c. records - the data
- We have data schema, we define the types of records, and all the data have to fit this schema. 
- They allow you to relate different tables - create relations.
- We have three types of relations: 
a. one-to-one
b. one-to-many
c. many-to-many
- The reason why it is called SQL is because it uses Queries 

2. NoSQL
a. collections - the same as tables
b. documents - this is how we describe data in JS

- NoSQL does not have a strict schema or structure
- There usually are not relations

3. Installation of MySQL database. 
So on MacOS, we need to install this: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ and also this: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

4. Working wiht MySQL database. 
In the database, you create some tables and views, and then work with your database with commands such as: 
    return db.execute("SELECT * FROM products WHERE products.id = ?", [id])
However it is simplier to work with tools such as Sequelize.
